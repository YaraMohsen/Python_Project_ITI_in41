# Python_Project_ITI_in41
## Wireless communication Track intake41 - Ismaillia


The project is a script using Python to generate an Inital files and GUI from configration files for an Embedded Systems projects. We will use the " DIO - Timer - UART - SPI " configration files. Then integrate all the output files in one file using GIT.


HOW TO RUN:

you need to download all files and keep them in one directory, but you only need to run one script "iTi_41_Tooling_Kit.py".

for this you will need to install to python_packages (PySimpleGUI & tkinter):
	# do not follow this step if you already have those packages
	$ sudo pip3 install PySimpleGUI
	$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
	
then you will need to run the following command once in project directory:
	$ sudo python3 iTi_41_Tooling_Kit.py    #for python3 (recommended)
# or 	$ sudo python iTi_41_Tooling_Kit.py     #for python2 or if you edited path variables
	
the Prephiral code will be generated on the screen for you, and also will creat a file in your directory
with the code, the file will be name <prephiral_name>.c
